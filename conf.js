Disabling the passphrase would weaken the security of your node as an attacker would need to steal only your seed which is stored in <data dir>/keys.json. Passphrase encrypts the keys, and keys.json alone would be useless for the attacker (if the passphrase is good). However, disabling the passphrase can make sense if you run a low-stakes wallet and absolutely need to start your node non-interactively.
